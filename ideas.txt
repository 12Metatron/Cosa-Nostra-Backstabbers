Role: Delayer (NC/Maf/Town)
The delayer can target each night. If the target has put in action that night, it will not happen, but instead, be delayed by one day. The target will know this, and therefore will be unable to put in an action on the next night. If the delayer's target's target is dead by the next day, then the delay is nulled, and the delayer's target may choose an action the next night. A delayer cannot target another delayer. If the delayer is roblocked, the roleblocker's action is delayed to the next day. In this scenario, the roleblocker and delayer are  effectively roleblocked for the next night. Keep in mind when the target's action is delayed, they would visit their target on the night of their action, however the action's effect will only take place on the next night. The target will not visit the next night.
